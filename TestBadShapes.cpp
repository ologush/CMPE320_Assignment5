/*
 * This file contains some truly ugly code.  The creation and population of the
 * vector<Shape*> collection of drawing shapes is OK, but the use of this collection
 * is incredibly awful.  Because polymorphism was not a consideration when the hierarchy
 * was constructed any code that attempts to draw a Shape must first determine what kind
 * of Shape object it has and then must invoke only the relevant drawing functions for
 * that shape.  Yuk!  And this hierarchy of Shapes is only partially populated - imagine
 * how much worse this code would be if you actually had objects for all possible shapes -
 * outlines only, filled and not filled, and with and without text!

 * For CISC/CMPE 320, Assignment 5
